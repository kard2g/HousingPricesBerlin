This is a collaborative git repository in which real estate prices in Berlin are analyzed. 

Contains:
1.: WebScraper 
Python webscraping to get the data.
2.: PriceTrend 
Reads and visualizes simple statistics like number of objects in the dataset, price mean, price median from the scraped data. 
3.: LinearRegressionSimple
Model learning for price prediction. The idea could be to either find a model which best predicts the price based on usefuel features. If there is a good model, it can be used to gain insight into the market. I personally would think that outliers might be interesting (e.g. the model predicts a high price and the actual price is way off, but this could be very hard to do). 

In any way, the data can be used to work on a real life dataset.
